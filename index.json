While pvclust provides it\u0026rsquo;s own plots via plot() on a pvclust object, this plots the dendrogram in base R. For readability and customisability reasons I prefer using the packages ggplot2 and ggtree for making my figures. However, I was having a hard time to extract the node uncertainty values from the pvclust object and integrate them into a generic R phylo object for plotting the dendrogram in ggtree.\nFortunately, a bit of googling (a couple of days\u0026hellip;) showed me someone else had already solved the problem of transferring additional hclust information into a phylo object but in a different context. The fastbap package has the function as.phylo.hclust.node.attributes()which essentially does what I needed to do - i.e. when calculating the node numbers from each merge event, also store with the same node number the corresponding attribute, or in this case,pvclust` AU value.\nI then modified this function slightly to make it more consistent with how pvclust will display the values in the base R plot (rounding and converting to a \u0026lsquo;percentage\u0026rsquo;). Note that this outputs in the phylo object the metadata node.label, not as node.attributes as in the original fastbaps function.\nSo in summary:\n## 1. Make pvclust object e.g. hclust_boot \u0026lt;- pvclust::pvclust(otu_matrix, method.hclust = selected_method, method.dist = \u0026quot;euclidean\u0026quot;, nboot = 1000, parallel = T) ## 2. Set modified fastbaps function as.phylo.pvclust.node.attributes \u0026lt;- function(x, attribute) { N \u0026lt;- dim(x$merge)[1] edge \u0026lt;- matrix(0L, 2*N, 2) edge.length \u0026lt;- numeric(2*N) ## `node' gives the number of the node for the i-th row of x$merge node \u0026lt;- integer(N) node[N] \u0026lt;- N + 2L node.attributes \u0026lt;- rep(NA, N) cur.nod \u0026lt;- N + 3L j \u0026lt;- 1L for (i in N:1) { edge[j:(j + 1), 1] \u0026lt;- node[i] for (l in 1:2) { k \u0026lt;- j + l - 1L y \u0026lt;- x$merge[i, l] if (y \u0026gt; 0) { edge[k, 2] \u0026lt;- node[y] \u0026lt;- cur.nod cur.nod \u0026lt;- cur.nod + 1L edge.length[k] \u0026lt;- x$height[i] - x$height[y] node.attributes[edge[k, 1] - (N + 1)] \u0026lt;- attribute[i] } else { edge[k, 2] \u0026lt;- -y edge.length[k] \u0026lt;- x$height[i] node.attributes[edge[k, 1] - (N + 1)] \u0026lt;- attribute[i] } } j \u0026lt;- j + 2L } if (is.null(x$labels)) x$labels \u0026lt;- as.character(1:(N + 1)) ## MODIFICATION: clean up node.attributes so they are in same format in ## pvclust plots node.attributes \u0026lt;- as.character(round(node.attributes * 100, 0)) node.attributes[1] \u0026lt;- NA obj \u0026lt;- list(edge = edge, edge.length = edge.length / 2, tip.label = x$labels, Nnode = N, node.label = node.attributes) class(obj) \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;phylo\u0026quot; stats::reorder(obj) } ## 3.

In this case I\u0026rsquo;m using the repo I used for my website  git remote -v git remote add upstream https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io.git  Find the changes in the upstream branch  git fetch upstream  Now check out of branch (not sure if this was needed, but didn\u0026rsquo;t do any harm)  git checkout master  Now we attempt to merge the changes. Git will take anything in the upstream branch, and if no change has been made on the my personal repo in the past, will make the change. Otherwise, merge conflict errors will be printed to screen.  git merge upstream/master  Take a look at which files have the merge conflicts, and inside each file look at the sections with \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;, ===== or \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; and manually remove the changes (normally the upstream, or one below the =====) that you don\u0026rsquo;t want changed.

To continue with this established \u0026lsquo;tradition\u0026rsquo;, I decided to investigate how to do this. Worringly, most people I spoke to didn\u0026rsquo;t have very positive views on this procdure, saying that it was complicated, error prone and badly documented and that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth my time. In fact, with a bit of help from the authors of some of the previous papers and with NCBI itself, the overall task ended up being easier than expected (admittedly after a considerable bit of trial and error).\nHere, I describe the eventual steps that I did to (successfully!) annotate a set of mtGenomes and make a submission to GenBank. However, note that these instructions are only valid for this use-case, and would not be necessarily valid for other situations.\nIn this case, we assume that you have multiple sequences of a species that already has an annotated reference sequence on GenBank. I use here the \u0026lsquo;Krause\u0026rsquo; reference (Accession: NC_007596.2) and my reconstructed mtGenomes.\nPreparation  Download the program Sequin from here (If running Ubuntu 16.04 might have to install libxp6 from the PPA here). Download the reference sequence from Genbank in FASTA format and the FeatureTable format. Using a multisequence aligner tool like MEGA or Geneious, align your sequences to the reference, and export the file as a FASTA file (make sure to export gaps as Ns, and not \u0026lsquo;-\u0026rsquo; as in the documentation, and keep the reference sequence!). To save time later, you now want to change the FASTA headers for each sequnce to the NCBI format, adding as much information as you can using the \u0026lsquo;modifiers\u0026rsquo; listed here. An example of one of my headers is as so:  \u0026gt;JK2760 [organism=Mammuthus primigenius] [country=Germany] [isolate=JK2760] Mammuthus primigenius isolate JK2760 mitochondrion, partial genome  For the reference sequence you should also add the tag [acc=NC_007596.2].\nUsing Sequin Next we can start Sequin, select \u0026lsquo;NCBI GenBank\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Start new submission\u0026rsquo;.    Set the release date of the data (for example if you want to release on the same day as your paper is published - note you can update this later) and add a tentative title for the study.    Set you name, phone and email (fax can be skipped).    Enter the names of the authors of the study.    Enter the submitting institution address (fax can be skipped).    Select the \u0026lsquo;use normal submission dialog\u0026rsquo; option.    Select \u0026lsquo;Population Study\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Alignment\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Original submission\u0026rsquo;.    Now you can import your FASTA alignment through the \u0026lsquo;Import Alignment\u0026rsquo; button and select the following options:   Trim Ns at the end of sequences: yes. Specify molecule: \u0026lsquo;Genomic DNA\u0026rsquo; (apply to all). Specify topology: \u0026lsquo;linear\u0026rsquo; (apply to all).       Select \u0026lsquo;Illumina\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;assembled sequences\u0026rsquo; and input your assembly program (in my case it is bwa and version \u0026lsquo;0.7\u0026rsquo;).    Next you can add various information like organisms, locations (e.g. here I selected mitochondrion) and genetic codes (to apply to all you can select the header). You can keep the genetic code as \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; or change to \u0026lsquo;Vertebrate Mitochondrial\u0026rsquo;. Some of this will have already been imported based on your FASTA headers.      You can skip the protein step. You can also skip annotation (select \u0026lsquo;none\u0026rsquo;) and \u0026lsquo;Continue to record viewer\u0026rsquo;.      First, it is best to annotate any runs of Ns as sequencing gaps (as per advice from the NCBI helpdesk). You can do this by doing the following:   In record viewer Go to Search Validate \u0026gt; Validate. Double click on a \u0026lsquo;run of Ns\u0026rsquo; error.    In the sequence viewer, type in the start position (-1) in the \u0026lsquo;Go to\u0026rsquo; box. Then click and drag until all the Ns are selected.    Then go to Features \u0026gt; Remaining Features \u0026gt; misc_features and under the \u0026lsquo;Properties\u0026rsquo; and then \u0026lsquo;Comment\u0026rsquo; tab you can add \u0026lsquo;sequencing gap, estimated length 119 bp\u0026rsquo;.     Once all of those are done, in the Record Viewer you need to select from the drop down menu the reference sequence (in this case NC_007596.2) and then File \u0026gt; Open the Genbank (flat)file or the feature table. This should automatically load all the annotations of the original sequence, also \u0026lsquo;importing\u0026rsquo; features that in the latest version of Sequin fail due to conflicts (e.g. I could not manually make a /trans_exep, but when I imported it gives an error but keeps the feature). Finally in the Record Viewer you can go Edit \u0026gt; Feature Propagate. This will copy over all of the annotations on the reference sequnce to your other sequences, but doing the correct DNA to amino acid translation.    You should now do another \u0026lsquo;validate\u0026rsquo; to find any errors. For example a couple of my translated amino acid sequences began with XXXXXX, so the Sequin couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the start codon and thus failed. I just removed these feature entries (and informed NCBI staff). Once you have no failures, you can go in Record Viewer to \u0026lsquo;File \u0026gt; Prepare Submission\u0026rsquo; and send the corresponding file to NCBI genbank as per the instructions. here.  Once done, after a few days you should recieve a message from the NCBI either with corrections to be made or a list of accession numbers, which will go live on the date you selected in Sequin.\nTo update or to get the release date changed you can just email them again at the same address (you don\u0026rsquo;t need to do a resubmission or use sequin).\n","date":1501718400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501718400,"objectID":"5cfb1623a6d629aa3b35ebed9dafebbd","permalink":"https://jfy133.github.com/post/2017-08-03-sequin-genbank-submission/","publishdate":"2017-08-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-08-03-sequin-genbank-submission/","section":"post","summary":"How to submit ancient mitochondrial consensus sequences to Genbank with Sequin","tags":["bioinformatics","ncbi","tutorial"],"title":"Sequin Submission to Genbank Tutorial","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"During my M.Sc. thesis I started to use the Bayesian phylogenetic MrBayes on clusters that do not make it feasible to keep open a terminal window. This meant I had to use ‚Äòbatch mode‚Äô, meaning I could only follow the status of the MrBayes run through the log files.\nOne issue I found when using MrBayes is that it is quite slow, so when I found my MCMC trace reached stability very early on in the chain, I wanted to stop the chain early, requiring me to force cancel the run. This meant that the data was not loaded in the program and I could not run the ‚Äòsump‚Äô or ‚Äòsumt‚Äô commands in MrBayes.\nI googled how to do cancel a MrBayes run early and found a couple of links (such as here and here). Although easy to do, neither explanations were particularly explicit in how finish the chain early and continue the analysis.\nThis post will give a quick step by step guide with additional notes on how to cancel a run early and to finish the analyses.\n  Submit your batch script to your cluster\n  Check your log file, and once you are at a stage you wish to stop the run, cancel the run.\n  To the end of every ‚Äò.t‚Äô file, in a text editor or with the command line, append to a new line without an indentation the following:\n     Note: If you want to ‚Äòround off‚Äô your number of steps in your chain, make sure you have the same numbers of entries in both .t and .p files. E.g. if you had already reached stability by 40,000,000 steps but you finished 40,000,125 - in all files delete lines below 40,000,000 and add ‚Äòend;‚Äô in the tree files.\nNow open MrBayes again (typically with mb) and re-load the original nexus file you selected in your batch file.  Note: If you selected a different name for the output of the run in your batch file, you may have to re-name the input nexus file to that of the output files (so it is the same as the .mcmc, .t, .p files etc.)\nNow, as you would normally, run the ‚Äòsump‚Äô and ‚Äòsumt‚Äô commands to summarise your run and generate your consensus trees.  Hopefully this will allow you to get your results much faster rather letting the run to finish (in my case saving around 3 weeks)!\n","date":1495929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495929600,"objectID":"0e3a8d31929378435fb60a0e4827a04f","permalink":"https://jfy133.github.com/post/2017-05-28-cancel-mybayes-early/","publishdate":"2017-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-05-28-cancel-mybayes-early/","section":"post","summary":"How to cancel MrBayes run early","tags":["mrbayes","phylogenetics"],"title":"How-to: cancel a MrBayes run early","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In Archaeology, or other disciplines that looking through deep time, you often want to represent change through time. A simple example of this, is representing the location different archaeological sites through different cultural periods.\nI have had an issue quite a few times during my B.Sc., M.Sc. and now in my P.hD., which is how to quickly make a series of \u0026lsquo;semi\u0026rsquo; good-looking maps, that simply represent the locations of different sites over time.\nMany people use fancy programs like qGIS to include terrain and other details, but often these tools (although powerful) are unwieldy to use and take a long time to get familiar with before producing something you are looking for. Although Google Maps is another alternative - such as through Google Drive\u0026rsquo;s Fusion tables, often I find this still does not look as professional as those you see in academic publications.\nThe programming language I am most familiar with currently is R, and although this also has a learning-curve, it is not too hard to copy and paste code into something like R-Studio and quickly get some output. Furthermore, for scientists, R is one of the best languages to go to for data analysis and manipulating data (as well as getting pretty plots).\nGoogling \u0026ldquo;maps in R\u0026rdquo; show many posts on how to do just that. However when I have tried this multiple times in the past, the many tutorials were either out-of-date, using packages that were even more out of date (one I used a year ago still used a map that had the Soviet Union!) and often these tutorials did not just give you an example of simply placing points on a map!\nThe closet tutorial I found was from here: https://www.r-bloggers.com/world-map-panel-plots-with-ggplot2-2-0-ggalt/, yet this was still doing much more than I actually needed.\nHere, I will document the simplest solution I have found, based on the above, requiring only a table of sites with metadata including \u0026lsquo;lat:lon\u0026rsquo; coordinates (in the form of decimals, as you would get from Google Maps), the base install of R, and the (arguably) best looking and most popular plotting package ggplot2,\nFor this example, I will use the coordinates of the places I have previously studied in and save this as a .tsv (tab separated) file :\n   City Lat Long PeriodYork     York 53.943540 -1.061194 B.Sc.

The image should then be saved in your \u0026lsquo;working directory\u0026rsquo; set at the beginning.\nBased on that basic outline, you can look into the ggplot2 for further modifications (point shapes, colouring by certain continuous values etc.)\n","date":1495929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495929600,"objectID":"40524efc780c2c8844adba8e43f37407","permalink":"https://jfy133.github.com/post/2017-05-28-maps-in-r/","publishdate":"2017-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-05-28-maps-in-r/","section":"post","summary":"How to make change over time / time transect maps for Archaeological science","tags":["r","how-to","maps"],"title":"How-to: Simple 'change over time' maps in R","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
