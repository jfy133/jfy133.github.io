    <h1>Personal Website for Dr. James A. Fellows Yates</h1>
    <p>Coming soon ™️ - Currently being re-written</p>
    <p>I am a post-doc bioinformatic researcher, working on high-throughput palaeogenomics, specialising in metagenomics and microbiomes.</p>
    <p>I also have an interest in building infrastructure for well-documented, user-friendly and high-throughput data processing. This includes building a metadata and tracking databases and tools (https://github.com/SPAAM-community/AncientMetagenomeDir), to processing data at various stages of metagenomic analyses, being the lead developer of Nextflow pipelines nf-core/eager (https://github.com/nf-core/eager), nf-core/taxprofiler (https://github.com/nf-core/taxprofiler), and (https://github.com/nf-core/funcscan), as well as developing tools in R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cuperdec/index.html, https://github.com/jfy133/MEx-IPA, https://github.com/sidora-tools/) and bash.</p>
    <p>In this vein, I have an interest in project management and training and teaching in such areas, being a core team member of the nf-core community of Nextflow best practises pipelines, as well as founder and maintainer of a grass-roots community of researchers - chairing and organising workshops and projects involving over 50 people from more than 10 countries (https://spaam-community.github.io).</p>
